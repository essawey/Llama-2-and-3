## Introduction

This repository contains three main Python notebooks, each demonstrating the use of advanced machine learning models for analyzing historical datasets. The models include fine-tuned versions of the Llama 2 and Llama 3 models, as well as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

## Notebook 1: Llama 2 Model

The first notebook demonstrates the application of the Llama 2 model, fine-tuned on specific historical datasets. This model is designed to provide accurate and insightful analyses of the data, highlighting important historical trends and patterns.

### Features:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training and fine-tuning
- Analysis and contextual generation

## Notebook 2: Llama 3 Model

The second notebook builds on the first by introducing the Llama 3 model. This model is also fine-tuned on historical datasets and provides enhanced performance and accuracy over the Llama 2 model.

### Features:
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Model training and fine-tuning
- Analysis and contextual generation

## Notebook 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

The third notebook explores the use of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This system combines the power of retrieval-based methods with generation-based models to provide more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

### Features:
- Integration of retrieval-based methods
- Huggingface Arabic BERT Large Model use
- Analysis and contextual generation

## Historical Datasets

The historical datasets used in these notebooks cover a wide range of historical periods and events. The data includes information on ancient civilizations, historical figures, and significant historical events.
